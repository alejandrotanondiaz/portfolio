			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

      <figure>

				<figcaption>
					This graphs show the amount of people by age group in 1900 and 2000
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I wanted to show which age groups were more present in society at the specific point in time</li>
				<li>I wanted to see if there were any interesting disparities in th enumber of women vs men as throughout different ages</li>
				<li>It is interesting how we can see some spikes in some age groups in the 2000 graph but not in 1900</li>
				<li>I also added some tiemstamps of evenst that happened around the times people were born to see if it showed some relation to the numbers</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img width="100%" src="images/A3-Sketch2_1.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				This graphs show the percentage difference of female vs male accross different age groups.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I wanted to see what the differences in amount of people were relative to their age group instead of to the overall population</li>
				<li>I also wanted to see if there was some correlation between sex and longevity which seems to be true but more drastic in 1900</li>
				
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img width="100%" src="images/A3-Sketch3_1.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This graph shows the percentag eof population growth for every age group
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I wanted to show if there were was a specific age group that had benefitted more from societal advances between 1900 and 2000.</li>
				<li>It shows how most of the advancements are associated with longevity as the older the age grouo the greater the increase in population</li>
				<li>It was originallya chart with positive and negative y axes until I noticed that no age group decreased in population</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        In the previous, I tried different strategies to show any difference in population between men and women between 1900 and 2000. In the first skecth, we can see interesting lumps in the line graph which could represent some events in the US. With the second sketch, I tried to show any drastic difference between different groups relative to their specific age group. The last graph shows the overall increase regardless of sex and shows an interesting trends as age goes up.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
        I decided to focus on the question regarding the increase in population as I think it had the most interesting results. Additionally, I decided to use a line graph instead of a bar chart to show more clearly which group had a higher increase.
      </p>


      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        The question I decided to tacke was how the increase of population looked in different age groups.
		I decided to split the graph into male and female such that it could be apparent how the increase by sex shifts as they get older. 
		In both datasets, there are more women than men in the later years but the increase of older men is way more drastic than the increse of older women.
	 </p>
	 <p>
		To make this visualization, I had to create a new metric in the data regarding percentage increase. To calculate this, I divided the 2000 number of people over the 1900 number of people and multiplied by 100 to get the percentage value. 
		I decided to choose the colors green and brown to label the sexes because I did not want to use color that are traditionally used for sexes and could perpetuate unintended stereotypes and perceptions into the visualization.
		I also labeled the lines in the graph itself to make it easier for the reader to understand what they meant.

	 </p>
	 <p>
		This final design is a combinations of the previous sketches I had made in phase 1. I liked how the multiple lines in sketch 1 differentiated majority between male and female. 
		Additionally, I choose which question to tackle based on sketch 3 and teh intriguing trend that can be seen on it.
