    <h2>Proposition: China is the world's biggest polluter</h2>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition: 1</h3>

      <figure>
				<img width="100%" src="images/China Polluter.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					While most countries have maintained similar emissions or decreaed, China has drastically been increasing them.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I decided to choose a line time graph to show the increase in China based on its industrialization.</li>
				<li>I decided to have the y-axis show total CO2 emissions so that China will be higher because of its size</li>
				<li>I decided to show most regiosn of the world to show the contrast with China</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition: -1</h3>

      <figure>
				<img width="100%" src="images/USA Polluter.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					The USA produces the highest amount of emission per capita.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I decided to use CO2 per capita so that it could show the hightened consumption levels of the USA.</li>
				<li>I sorted the list by highest amount to make it easier to read.</li>
				<li>I decided to use multiple nations and regions such that China seems farther from the USA.</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
		For this exercise, I wanted to use climate change as it is one of our most pressing issues and one that has led to throwing around culpability between different actors. I also wanted to integrate some ways China is vilified by the mainstream media in the United States. Based on this, I knew I wanted to play with total versus per capita measurements and how we can use these measurements to transmit a desired message.
		It was really interesting how the same information can be presented to provoke different emotions. Also, it was intriguing and a bit worrisome to discover how statistical concepts like total vs per capita, which serve a specific purpose can be coopted and weaponized for something they are not meant to be used for. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I think a persuasive choice is one that stays true to the utility of the measurements being used but maybe tries to amplify the trend but always in a manner that is in line with an analysis using the intended statistical purpose. A misleading choice, however, is one in which a certain message is amplified with visual aids but the substance of the visual aid is not necessarily aligned with the premise that is being promoted but is close enough for the reader to be convinced.
